# Problem

To run all the specs together

If you run that spec on its own though, it succeeds

```
sammael :0: ~/test3 git:()!Â» bin/rspec spec/defines/test__aoeu_spec.rb 
Mocha deprecation warning: Test::Unit or MiniTest must be loaded *before*
Mocha.
Mocha deprecation warning: If you're integrating with another test library, you
should probably require 'mocha_standalone' instead of 'mocha'
.

It only seems to happen when the spec is run after the another spec that
doesn't call the custom native type (`foo`)
